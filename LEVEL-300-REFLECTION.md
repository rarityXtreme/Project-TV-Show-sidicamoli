Level 300 Code Comparison – Mohamed Ibrahim 

Comparing my Level 200 Pull Request with my partner "Hendrine Zeraua" Pull Request.



How is it different?
Partner centered controls and placed code before title; I moved controls left, display selector before search, and made title appear as Title - SxxExx in a title bar above the image.

What I prefer about my implementation:
Controls are left-aligned and easier to access; titles are user-friendly (title first) and shown in a visible label bar; image is centered for a cleaner card look.

What I prefer about their implementation:
Their code was simpler in some parts — fewer DOM helpers — which made it quick to read; I kept the clean parts and refactored where needed.

What I learned:
How to integrate someone else’s layout into mine, and how small UI differences (control alignment, title placement) significantly change usability and visual hierarchy.
